# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortner 📎

In this project I created my own [URL shortener]🤏🏻

✅Each user can insert as many urls a he desires, to he privet storage.📝

✅Each Url is being saved with the following data:

- Creation Time
- Full Url
- Shorten Url
- Redirect Counter

  ✅Each Url can be accessed with it's link,
  or using his unique shorten id🗝️

  ✅Each Url is being saved to a local Data Base and to an External one,
  using JSONBIN.io services 📥

  ✅All the Url's have a statistics page, containing all their relative Data🔎

  ✅Each Url has a Redirect counter, showing how many times his short link was used

## Testing

In this assignment, i have created my own tests.
Those tests allow me to make sure that my URL shortener work's as planned.
During the work I used a separate DB file for my tests.📂

## Bonuses

- styled statistics dashboard instead of the default JSON statistics
- Usage the [`JSONBIN.io`](https://jsonbin.io/) service bin as my persistent layer in my back-end DB class (use CRUD operations to read write bins)

ENJOY! 🤘
