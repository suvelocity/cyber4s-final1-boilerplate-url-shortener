# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortner ðŸ“Ž

## Sexyurl shortner

A url shortner site that can recieve a long and ugly url and attached to it a shorter url that is built from my site url along with a unique id that helps us to redirect to the original url you have chosen to get shorten.

## extra features

I added a "go pro " version , in real working shorturl services you can pay money to have the abbility to chose your own slug . when you press the go pro button and extra input will pop on the screen and you can add you own personal slug , and if its not taken you can have it !

## project basic structure

Project build from back side (server dir) and front side(front dir+dist) , the project was built with webpack .
